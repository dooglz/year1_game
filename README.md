### Step 1 - Create a Github Repo for your project<a name="s1"></a>

If you have not already created a github account, create one and sign in.

(As a student you get some cool swag from github: [check it out](https://education.github.com/pack))

Give your repo a simple name and descriptive description

Check - Initialize with a readme

Choose an open source license, so people cant legally steal your work without crediting you. The inbuilt guide from github covers this neatly, when in doubt: choose MIT license.

After this stage Github will create the repo for you and you should see something like the following image, now it's time to **clone** the repo down so you can start to work within it. Click the green clone button and copy the link within the box

### Step 2 - Clone your repo<a name="s2"></a>

If you haven't installed Git on your pc yet, [do so now](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Open a cmd (or git-bash) window somewhere (desktop is best). Now clone your repo down
```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/year1_game
```
This will create a folder named year1_game (or whatever you called you repo). Let's move into that folder in the terminal
```bash
cd year1_game
```
Now if you run
```bash
git status
```


### Step 3 - Add PhaserJS source files<a name="s3"></a>

### Step 4 - Running a simple webserver<a name="s4"></a>

### Step 5 - Pushing to your repo<a name="s5"></a>

### Step 6 - Enabling github pages<a name="s6"></a>

### Step 7 - Add collaborators<a name="s7"></a>
